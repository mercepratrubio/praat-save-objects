# praat-save-objects
This script allows the user to save objects in the Praat menu. One can choose to save only the TextGrids, only the Sounds or both; as well as removing all objects from the menu when finished. My first script :) created with the help of @wendyelviragarcia and @ebrenc. Happy to recieve any feedback!

WARNINGS
The script will only work on selected files: make sure you have selected them in the objects menu.
The script will save the files with the same name they were uploaded with. If there is a file with a matching name on the output folder, it will rewrite it.

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Select all files you wish to save.
2. Open the script file and click "Run" > "Run" on the Praat Script window.
3. Choose your settings in the pop-up window.
4. Click "Apply" or "Ok"
5. If Praat returns "Completed", all is well!
