# praat-save-objects
This script allows the user to save objects in the Praat menu. One can choose to save only the TextGrids, only the Sounds or both; as well as removing all objects from the menu when finished. My first script :) created with the help of @wendyelviragarcia and @ebrenc. Happy to recieve any feedback!
